# Guide

 - The guiding focus to how to write a client to connect to a Tokyo server, receive information events and create actions to control your ship

## 1. Connection information

`ws://${host}/socket?room_token={room_token}key={key}&name{name}`

| Parameters | Description |
|--|--|
| {host} | Domain or IP of server want to connect |
| {room_token} | Room's token is unique for room |
| {key} | User's identity is unique and used to distinguish bots |
| {name} | The display name will be shown on UI |

When the WebSocket connection is established successfully, your bot is registered, displayed on web UI and ready to use.

## 2. Action commands

Through WebSocket, a client can send action commands to control their ship.

### 2.1. Rotate the ship

```json
{"e": "rotate", "data": 0.5}
```

| Fields | Description |
|--|--|
| e | Event information "rotate" |
| data | Set the radian value that the ship will head. Value's between [0, 2π] |

![Radian example](https://flylib.com/books/3/315/1/html/2/images/figu345_1.jpg)

### 2.2. Throttle

Set the speed of your ship. Your ship starts to move forward with a new speed.
Set 0 to stop your ship.

```json
{"e": "throttle", "data": 0.5}
```

| Fields | Description |
|--|--|
| e | Event information "throttle" |
| data | Speed value. It's between [0, 1] |

### 2.3. Fire a bullet

```json
{"e": "fire"}
```

| Fields | Description |
|--|--|
| e | Event information "fire" |

## 3. Events

From WebSocket, the server consecutively sends events to the client every tick with the following structure.
Event message structure contains all world info of the game, including players, bullets, dead person, etc.

### 3.1. Events structure

#### 3.1.1. State event

State event contains world map states that includes map info, players, bullets, dead and scoreboard

```json
{
  "e": "state",

    ],
    "bullets": [
      {},
      {}
    ],
    "dead": [
      {
        "respawn":{
           "secs_since_epoch":1631299999,
           "nanos_since_epoch":940876053
         },
         "player": {}
       }
    ],

```

| Fields | Description |
|--|--|
| e | State event is is always "id" |
| data | id of current user |

#### 3.1.3. User event
